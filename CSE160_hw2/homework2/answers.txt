Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 3:

When you put a # in front of a line, it tells python to ignore this line. Therefore, an error occured,
where the variable ge_count is no longer defined.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:

For sample_1.fastq, the sum of G+C+A+T count is 26980735, 
while total count and the length of nucleotide are 27000000.
The differences between the sum of G+C+A+T count and the other two variables may be caused by
the sequence in the sample has elements that is not G, C, A, or T. For example, there's a N in
the sequence in sample_5.fastq, which resulted in the sum of G+C+A+T count is one less than the
other two variables.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content

Collaboration:
