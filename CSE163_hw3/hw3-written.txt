1. a) No, I don't think bar chart is a effective way to visualize this data.
      It is because that bar chart is effective when showing changes over time for particular categories,
      so when we're only looking at one specific time, it doesn't make any meaningful comparison.
   b) I chose to use bar chart to demonstrate the idea I mentioned in the previous answer.
      This chart is able to show the changes in percentages throughtout the year,
      and we can clearly find a upward trend in both categories.

2. This dataset only present a percentage of samples. The first bias that I can think of is that
   this dataset may not be representative simply because it is only a very small proportion of the
   total population. Also, it is specified that the people selected are those between 25 to 29.
   Some may be still pursuing a higher degree, so the bias in this case is the number could be conservative.

3. The dataset could be misused toward showing that the percentage of female earning at least 
   an bachelor's degree is higher than male's percentage. This can be interpret as females 
   are smarter than males, which is definitely an inaccurate statement. Or it could be showing
   that certain ethnic group have consistently lower percentage in completing at least high school.
   Therefore, they are dumber or less diligent than other groups, which is definitely another bad statement.
